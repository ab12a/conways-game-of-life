# Conway's Game of Life

A Python implementation of Conway’s Game of Life using Pygame.

## Description

This project simulates Conway’s Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. The simulation uses the Pygame library for visualization and interaction.

## Features

- Interactive grid to visualize cell evolution
- Start, pause, and reset the simulation
- Adjustable speed and grid size (if implemented)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ab12a/conways-game-of-life.git
